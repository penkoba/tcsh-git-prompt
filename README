a patch to tcsh-6.17.00
to embed git branch name to your prompt, like:

penkoba@localhost:/home/penkoba/src/stupid_code<master>[1]%

Here you can find the latest release of tcsh

  http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease

and this patch can be applied on top of it.

Maybe it is insane idea to put a patch on the github, but I don't know
if I could put a tcsh mirror there arbitrarily...


Compiled and tested on Linux and cygwin.
